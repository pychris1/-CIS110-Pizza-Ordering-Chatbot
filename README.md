This project was developed using Python as part of my Intro to Programming class. It showcases the basic syntax and essential programming concepts while creating a fun, interactive pizza ordering chatbot. The chatbot allows users to select pizza sizes, toppings, and customize their orders. Through this project, I explored fundamental elements such as variables, loops, conditional statements, and user input handling, providing a hands-on experience in applying core programming skills. The project also demonstrates how simple coding can be used to build an engaging and functional application.
